waht is ddl and dml  ?

DDL stands for data definition language 

DML stands for data manipulation language 


lets understand the terms and actions performed closely:

DDL - > DEFINITION Means when there is nothing and when we create something we call it as defined 

same way when we dont have a data base and table in the database 

then we create it 

and also when we  created the table ,we can drop the table , we can alter the table 

what is drop -> remove 

what is alter -> make changes,add new columns ..

create_table:
-------------
create table customer(
customer_id int,
customer_name varchar(20),
customer_last_name varchar(20)
) 

drop_table:
---------
DROP TABLE customer

alter_table:
----------
alter table customer add column customer_contact varchar(20) 




the DDL is only used to create th schema not the values in the table 

schema means -> column names like -> order_id,order_date,customer_id,order_status 


so what we use to create vales:

DML:
Data manipulation language :

in this we have insert ,update,delete,truncate 

and there is also a data query language which is used to query the tables -> select 

insert:
--------

insert into customers values()


update:
------
update orders 
set 
order_id = 1 
where name = 'ajay'


delete:
-----
delete from orders where order_status = 'closed'
